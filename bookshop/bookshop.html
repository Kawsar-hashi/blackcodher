                in the beautiful Syrian city of Aleppo - until the unthinkable happens. When all they care for is
                destroyed by war, they are forced to escape.
                But what Afra has seen is so terrible she has gone blind, and so they must embark on a perilous journey
                through Turkey and Greece towards an uncertain future in Britain.
                On the way, Nuri is sustained by the knowledge that waiting for them is Mustafa, his cousin and business
                partner, who has started an apiary and is teaching fellow refugees in Yorkshire to keep bees.
                As Nuri and Afra travel through a broken world, they must confront not only the pain of their own
                unspeakable loss, but dangers that would overwhelm the bravest of souls.
